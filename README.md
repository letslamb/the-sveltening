# the-sveltening

My personal component library for building accessible Svelte applications & not struggling with layout. This library contains 3 main sections:

  1. Toolbox
    - **layout** low-level layout context components, _heavily_ based on Heydon Pickering & Andy Bell's [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev). These components solve most common layout needs. If you want to learn more about how they work and how to leverage browser algorithms to make your own design system, you should buy [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev). They also offer a sizable chunk of their content for free, so you can sample it and see for yourself before buying.
    - **everything else** 
      - this is a test
